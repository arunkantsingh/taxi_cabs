Taxi Cab Data Analysis â€“ Project Description
Project Overview:
An end-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding taxi ride patterns, demand trends, and revenue insights using real-world taxi trip datasets. The goal is to derive actionable business strategies for fleet management and pricing optimization.
Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and standardized time and location data for accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified peak demand hours, top routes, seasonal ride patterns, and revenue contributors using Python libraries.
Visual Insights: Created interactive visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to showcase trip trends and geographical heatmaps.
Business Recommendations: Suggested fleet distribution strategies, surge pricing windows, and route optimization to increase profitability.
Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Plotly | Jupyter Notebook | 
Key Questions Answered:
What are the peak demand times and high-revenue routes?
How do ride distances and durations affect pricing?
Which locations generate the highest traffic and revenue?
What seasonal or day-of-week trends exist for better resource planning?
